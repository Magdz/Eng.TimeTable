# Eng.TimeTable

For students of faculty of Engineering Alexandria University.

Here is the place where you can easily create and design your own Timetable

[Live Webpage!](https://magdz.github.io/Eng.TimeTable/)

# Concepts

- The main concept of this webpage is to provide an easy tool for students to make their timetable instead of the traditional ways.
- This page provides the users with a simple tool using only the user's input with no complex processing and using public data provided by the college timetables, So this page should always be a Client Side based web page and to provide an effective functionality without the need for a Server Side.
